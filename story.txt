Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no <CAT>
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on <SPACE>, I thought I would <JUMP> about
a little and see the <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> part of the <CAT>. It is a way I have of driving off the
<ROAD> and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the <FOREST>;
whenever it is a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>, <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> November in my <HOUSE>; whenever I find myself involuntarily
<TRIPPING> before coffin <PARTY>, and bringing up the rear of every <CELEBRITY> I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <RUNNING> into the <EARTH>, and methodically
<RIPPING> people's <BACKPACKS> off—then, I account it high time to get to <COLLEGE> as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all <ANIMALS> in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the <DOG> with me.
